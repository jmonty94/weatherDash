## Overview

### The Challenge

This was a challenge to create a dynamic Weather Dashboard for a user to search for cities and get the current weather plus a 5 day forecast.

### The User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
Mock-Up
```

## My Process

### Built with

- jQuery and Vanilla JS due to some complications from MDBootstrap and jquery

### What I Learned

Due to MDBootstrap also using jquery there are some issues when creating elements for cards using jquery when MDBootstrap is installed

### Continued Development

Would like to go over and reformat

### Useful resources
